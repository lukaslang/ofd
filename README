3. Requirements

This software was originally written for and tested with Matlab R2012b.
It has been recently modified to also run with R2015a.

Note that this software uses the TriRep class which since R2013a is marked 
as 'will be removed in a future release'. It also used flipdim, which will 
be removed at some point in the future.

See http://www.mathworks.de/de/help/matlab/release-notes.html

The following libraries are required for parts of this sofware:

xUnit: used for testing.
URL: http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/22846-matlab-xunit-test-framework 

export_fig: used for producing high quality figures from the results.
URL: http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23629-exportfig

4. Usage

For easier use we provide a startup script (startup.m), which sets up the 
Matlab search path. It includes required libraries and adds required 
subdirectories. Make sure to download the required packages and to set the 
library paths properly. Then simply run the startup script.

To run the test cases execute

>> runtests test

or

>> runtests test -verbose

to get more information (see xUnit for more information).

The following run scripts are included:

- runof.m (computes optical flow on sphere)
- runofd.m (computes a u+v decomposition)
- runodb.m (used different bases for u and v)
- runofhd.m (computes a hierarchical decomposition)
- runhelmholtz.m (computes a Helmholtz decomposition)

The following scripts also exist but were not included in the paper:

- runsurffit.m (fitting a sphere-like surface)
- runofs.m (optical flow on sphere-like surfaces)
- runofc.m (continuity equation-based velocity estimation)

If you want to reproduce the experiments from the paper run

- experiments/prepare.m (creates and stores linear system)
- experiments/runofexperiments.m (computes optical flow and Helmholtz decompositions)
- experiments/runofdexperiments.m (computes u+v decompositions)
- experiments/runofhdexperiments.m (computes hierarchical decompositions)

and the appropriate experiments/render{of, ofd, ofhd}experiments.m script 
to create and store all the figures.
