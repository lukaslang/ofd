3. Requirements

This software was written for and tested with Matlab R2012b.

The following libraries are required for parts of this sofware:

xUnit: used for testing.
URL: http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/22846-matlab-xunit-test-framework 

export_fig: used for producing high quality figures from the results.
URL: http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23629-exportfig

sphereFit: used for fitting a sphere to data.
http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/34129-sphere-fit-least-squared

4. Usage

For easier use we provide a startup script (startup.m), which sets up the Matlab search path. It includes required libraries and adds required subdirectories. Make sure to download the required packages and to set the library paths properly. Then simply run the startup script.

To run the test cases execute

>> runtests test

or

>> runtests test -verbose

to get more information (see xUnit for more information).
